My specialty is closed to IT. Information technology (IT) is a specific sector that is responsible for the building of computer systems and the management of computer networks.

Professional development is very important for any specialist. There are personal professional and continuing professional development. The aim of personal and professional development is to help you to manage your own learning and growth throughout your career. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is a process of building, maintaining and enhancing your knowledge and skills.
