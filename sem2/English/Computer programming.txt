Computer programs are developed by computer programmers or software engineers. Computer programming include planning, coding, testing, and documenting. 
Programming paradigms are different methods to writing computer programs that show different ways of thinking about programming. Todayâ€™s most popular programming paradigms are:
1)	Event-driven
2)	Procedural
3)	Object-oriented
4)	Declarative

Object-oriented programming is one of the main programming methodologies, which is based on the idea that a program is a set of objects, that interact with each other. The three principles of OOP:
1)	Encapsulation.
2)	Inheritance.
3)	Polymorphism.

Artificial Intelligence(AI) is the ability of a machine or a computer program to think and learn. Advantages of AI is its ability to process large mount of data quickly. AI can also automate repetitive tasks.

Virtual reality (VR) is when you wear a special headset that shows you a computer-generated world, so it feels like you're inside it.
Augmented reality (AR) is when you use your phone or a special headset to see digital information, like pictures or text, displayed over the real world.

Robotic systems are machines that can perform tasks automatically, without human intervention. The building blocks of a robotic system include the mechanical body, control system and power supply.

There are several types of robots:
	pre-programmed
	humanoid
	autnomous
	teleoperated
